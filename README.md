# Connect4 AI
This project is a Connect4 game developed in Java, featuring a simple graphical user interface (GUI) and an AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The AI efficiently evaluates possible moves to provide a challenging gameplay experience, minimizing computational overhead while making optimal decisions. The game offers a smooth, interactive experience for users to play against the AI in the classic Connect4 format.
